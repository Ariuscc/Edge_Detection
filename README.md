1.Load a grayscale image.

2.Detect edges using the Roberts Cross operator.

3.Group connected edge pixels into contours via a breadth-first search (BFS).

roberts_cross(image)
Implements the Roberts Cross edge detector. For each pixel, it computes gradients along the two diagonal directions and combines them into a single value (0â€“255).

detect_contours(edge_image, threshold=10)
Scans the edge map, grouping neighboring pixels above the threshold into distinct contours. Returns a list of contours, where each contour is a list of pixel coordinates.
